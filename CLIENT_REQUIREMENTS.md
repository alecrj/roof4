## üì± **How to Collect Assets:**

### **Photo Collection:**
**Text message:**
```
Perfect! I need 4-6 photos of your recent roofing work and 1 business photo (team/trucks).

You can:
- Text them to me
- Email to [your email]
- Send via Google Drive link

High quality photos make the biggest difference!
```

### **If They Don't Have Good Photos:**
**Upsell photo service (+$300):**
```
No problem! I can arrange a professional photographer to come take photos of your next 2-3 jobs.

This adds $300 but gives you amazing photos to use for marketing beyond just the website.

Or we can start with phone photos for now and upgrade later.
```

### **If They're Slow to Respond:**
**Follow-up after 3 days:**
```
Hey [Name], just checking on those photos for your website.

The sooner I get them, the sooner your site goes live and starts working for you!

Need help with anything?
```

---

## üí∞ **Payment Collection:**

### **Standard Process:**
- **$400 upfront** when they agree
- **$400 when site goes live** (usually next day)

### **Payment Methods:**
- Venmo/Zelle (fastest)
- Square/Stripe card payment
- Check (for local clients)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Red Flags / Problem Clients:**

### **Avoid These Situations:**
- Want "just a few small changes" after approval
- Ask for multiple rounds of revisions
- Want to pay "when they get their next job"
- Want you to find/buy all the photos
- Keep changing their mind about content

### **How to Handle:**
**Set clear boundaries:**
```
I include one round of basic changes. Additional revisions are $100/hour.

The goal is to get you a professional website quickly, not to design something custom from scratch.
```
