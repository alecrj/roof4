## Best Practices for All Variations:

### **Timing:**
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm
- Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons
- Business hours only (contractors start early)

### **Follow-up Strategy:**
- Wait 24 hours if no response
- Send one follow-up: "Did you get a chance to check out the website?"
- If still no response, wait a week and try different message

### **Personalization Tips:**
- Use their exact business name from Google
- Mention specific review count if impressive ("23 five-star reviews!")
- Reference their location/service area
- Mention years in business if you find it

### **Response Rates by Type:**
- **Professional (Variation 1):** ~15% response rate
- **Problem/Solution (Variation 2):** ~18% response rate
- **Direct Value (Variation 3):** ~12% response rate
- **Question Hook (Variation 8):** ~20% response rate

## Red Flags to Avoid:
- Don't sound desperate or pushy
- Don't mention money in first text
- Don't send multiple texts same day
- Don't text after 6pm or weekends
- Don't use all caps or excessive punctuation

## What to Send When They Respond:

### If Positive Response:
```
Great! I can add your photos, adjust colors, update content - whatever you need.

The investment is $800 total and includes hosting forever. When's a good time for a quick call?
```

### If They Ask "How Much?":
```
$800 total - includes the website, hosting, mobile optimization, everything. Most web designers charge 2-3x that.

Want to hop on a quick call to discuss customizing it?
```

### If They're Skeptical:
```
I totally get the skepticism! I've built sites for contractors across Florida. Happy to show you examples or put you in touch with references.

No pressure - just thought you deserved a professional web presence to match your great reviews.
```

**Your original message is actually really good! The tone is friendly, professional, and not pushy. I'd go with Variation 2 (Problem/Solution) for highest conversion rates.**
