## Pro Tips for Higher Conversion:

### Make It Personal:
*"I was looking at your Google profile - I see you've been in business since 2010 and have great reviews. That's exactly the kind of established contractor who should have a professional website."*

### Create Urgency:
*"I only work with one roofer per city to avoid competition issues. I've got three roofers interested in [City], so first one who says yes gets it."*

### Handle Skepticism:
*"I know it sounds weird that I built it first, but look - would you rather spend months going back and forth with a web designer, or see the finished product right now and decide if you want it?"*

### Build Trust:
*"You can check out my work for other contractors at [your-portfolio-site]. I've done this for 20+ roofing companies across Florida."*

**Prospecting:** 10 new prospects researched
**Calling:** 50 dials = 10 conversations = 2 sales
**Revenue:** $1600/day average
**Time:** 8 hours total work
