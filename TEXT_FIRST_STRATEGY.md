# Text First, Then Call Strategy Analysis

## üì± **Text-First Approach: BRILLIANT MOVE**

### **Why This Strategy CRUSHES Cold Calling:**

**1. Eliminates Gate Keepers**
- Texts go directly to the decision maker
- No secretary or office manager blocking you
- Business owner sees it immediately

**2. Creates Immediate Curiosity**
- They're looking at THEIR website with THEIR company name
- Visual proof beats verbal description every time
- Hard to ignore when they see their name on a professional site

**3. Breaks Through Noise**
- Everyone calls, few text professionally
- Text feels more personal and direct
- They can view it when convenient

**4. Pre-qualifies Interest**
- If they look at the site, they're interested
- If they don't respond to text, save time - don't call
- Only call warm leads who've seen the product

## üéØ **Optimal Text-First Workflow:**

### **Step 1: Research & Build (Morning)**
- Find 10 contractors with Google profiles, no websites
- Build 5 custom websites with their company names
- Deploy to Netlify with company-specific URLs

### **Step 2: Mass Text (Midday)**
**Text Template:**
```
Hi [Name] from [Company Name] - I built a website for your roofing business.

Check it out: [company-name].netlify.app

Calling you in 10 minutes.
- [Your Name], [Your Number]
```

**Send 20 texts in 30 minutes**

### **Step 3: Follow-Up Calls (Afternoon)**
- Wait 5-10 minutes after each text
- Call with: "Did you see the website I sent?"
- They've already seen their name on a professional site
- Close becomes: "It's built. $800. Yes or no?"

## üí™ **Why This Approach Is Superior:**

### **Vs. Cold Calling Only:**
- ‚ùå Cold call: "Can I tell you about a website?"
- ‚úÖ Text first: "Look at YOUR website right now"

### **Vs. Email Only:**
- ‚ùå Email gets buried in inbox
- ‚úÖ Text gets read within 3 minutes (98% open rate)

### **Vs. In-Person Only:**
- ‚ùå Driving around wastes hours
- ‚úÖ Text 50 people while sitting at coffee shop

## üìä **Expected Results:**

**20 texts sent** =
- 15 people view the website (75%)
- 12 people answer follow-up call (60%)
- 3 people buy ($2400 daily revenue)
- 2 hours total time invested

**ROI: $1200/hour**

## üöÄ **Pro Tips for Maximum Impact:**

### **Text Timing:**
- **Best times:** 10-11am, 2-3pm (business owners check phones)
- **Avoid:** Early morning, lunch, end of day
- **Day of week:** Tuesday-Thursday (Monday too busy, Friday mentally checked out)

### **Text Psychology:**
- Use their exact company name from Google
- Keep it professional but direct
- Create urgency with "calling in 10 minutes"
- Include your name and number (builds trust)

### **Follow-Up Call Strategy:**
- Don't ask IF they saw it, assume they did
- Lead with: "What did you think of the website?"
- If they didn't see it: "Check your texts, I'll hold while you look"
- Close fast: Website is done, $800, yes or no

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Risks & Solutions:**

### **Risk: Seems Spam-ish**
**Solution:** Professional text, real website, local phone number

### **Risk: They Think It's Fake**
**Solution:** Website has their actual business info, proves legitimacy

### **Risk: Legal Issues**
**Solution:** Business texting is legal, you're providing a service
